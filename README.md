# Enhancements for YouTube

[Download on the AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/enhancements-for-youtube/id1643308157)

## What is this?

For the first year or so of running the app, I tried to manage support tickets myself, but that proved to be WAY TO MUCH for one person. This is the new repo for managing issues/bugs for Enhancements for YouTube. 

If you are experiencing an bug or issue (ads not being blocked, etc.) please [report it](https://github.com/iOSDeveloperGuy/Enhancements-for-Youtube/issues)!

__Thank you!!__
